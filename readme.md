Performant sorting for complex input.

## Preface

**You do not need this library unless you are having performance issues.** `mapsort` does not add any functionality not present in plain JavaScript. Rather, it greatly improves your performance in case:

* sorting is your bottleneck, and
* the elements in your arrays require expensive preprocessing before their correct order can be determined.

# Concept

Imagine we are sorting this array of numbers, represented as strings:
```javascript
['12', '1', '3.14']
```
Sorting them with no compare function would place `'12'` before `'3.14'`, so we need such a function:
```javascript
['12', '1', '3.14'].sort((a, b) => parseFloat(a) - parseFloat(b));
```
This works!

The drawback is that `parseFloat` is called twice every time our compare function is used. Sorting three numbers results in 6 (or 4) `parseFloat` calls, of which only 3 are strictly necessary.

3 or 6 `parseFloat` calls makes no difference. However, next time we might be sorting names. _Lucia Ávila_ would like to appear amidst the other **A**s, thus we have to correctly handle [diacritics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacritic). _Amelie de Wit_ would like to appear amidst the other **W**s, thus we have to detect [tussenvoegsels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tussenvoegsel). And the number of calls to the compare function grows loglinearly with the number of names. As our preprocessing becomes more expensive and our arrays become longer, this could produce perceivable hiccups.

`mapsort` reduces the number of times an element is preprocessed to 1:
```javascript
mapSort(['12', '1', '3.14'], parseFloat, (a, b) => a - b);
```

# Installation

Install `mapsort` using npm or Yarn and import the function:
```javascript
import mapSort from 'mapsort';
```

Alternatively, include `mapsort` through unpkg:
```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/mapsort@^1.0.8"></script>
```
This alternative makes the function available at `window.mapSort`.

# Usage

``` javascript
const sortedArray = mapSort(
	array,
	element => {
		// Return the version of "element" which is ideal for
		// sorting. This version is passed to the compare
		// function below.
	},
	(a, b) => {
		// (Optional.) Return a negative number if a comes
		// before b; a positive number if b comes before a; or
		// 0 if they are equal.
	}
);
```

## Notes

* Contrary to [`[].sort`][mdn-sort], this library **does not sort in-place**. It returns a new, sorted array. The original array is left untouched
* This library [probably][stable-sorting] performs stable sorting.
